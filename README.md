# EnergyEfficiencyModeling

Energy performance estimation is a vital component of sustainable architectural design, and having accurate load predicitions is key to building efficiency. If heating and cooling loads are overestimated, construction and operational costs increase unnecessarily, and if they are underestimated, energy conservation goals and occupatn comfort are compromised.
